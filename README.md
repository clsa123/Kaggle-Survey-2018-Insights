# Kaggle-Survey-2018-Insights

The goal of this project is to extract useful insights from kaggle survey through python visualization.
I want to find out all the information related to data science so that I can have a better understanding of this field.

It contains three parts:

1. Demographic of respondents
2. Application and salary of data science
3. How to enter the field of data science

There are four files in this repository:

1. Kaggle Survey.ipynb: code plus output
2. README.md: Description of the project
3. multipleChoiceResponses.zip: kaggle survey 2018 dataset
4. ne_110m_admin_0_countries.shp: geo location of each country

Libraries:
1. pandas
2. numpy
3. seaborn
4. folium
5. branca
6. babel
7. textwrap
8. geopandas
8. matplotlib

To summmarize:
1. Majority of the respondents are male, and most of them comes from America and India
2. Data Science is well applied in most of the industry, and the salary is relevant high compare to other fields
3. Individual who holds a Bachelor degree or above in STEM field, and proficient in python, is more likely land a job in this field.
